Here is the `README.md` for your **models** folder.

You should place this file inside the `models/` directory. It is crucial because it explains to anyone (or your future self) what the binary files inside actually are and how to use them.

# 🧠 PocketQuant Models

This directory stores the **fine-tuned model adapters (LoRA weights)** and potentially the **quantized GGUF files** generated by the PocketQuant project.

## 📂 Directory Structure

When you save a model using `model.save_pretrained("models/gemma-2b-finqa")`, the following files will be created inside a subfolder:

```
models/
├── gemma-2b-finqa/          # (Example) Adapter for Gemma 2B
│   ├── adapter_config.json  # Configuration (Rank, Alpha, Target Modules)
│   ├── adapter_model.safetensors # The actual trained weights (~50MB - 200MB)
│   └── README.md            # Auto-generated model card by PEFT
├── llama-3b-finqa/          # (Example) Adapter for Llama 3B
│   ├── ...
└── GGUF/                    # (Optional) Quantized models for local use
    ├── gemma-2b-finqa.gguf  # Single file model for Ollama/Llama.cpp
    └── llama-3b-finqa.gguf

```

## 🚀 How to Load These Models

You do not need to download the full 10GB base model to this folder. The `adapter_model.safetensors` file contains *only* the changes you trained.

### **Option 1: Python (Unsloth / Transformers)**

To load a saved adapter from this folder:

```python
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

# 1. Load the Base Model first (it downloads from HuggingFace automatically)
model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name = "unsloth/gemma-2-2b-bnb-4bit", # Or "unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-bnb-4bit"
    max_seq_length = 2048,
    dtype = None,
    load_in_4bit = True,
)

# 2. Load the Fine-Tuned Adapter from this folder
model.load_adapter("models/gemma-2b-finqa")

# 3. Ready for Inference!
FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model)

```

### **Option 2: GGUF (Local Use with Ollama)**

If you exported the model to GGUF format (see `notebooks/04_Inference.ipynb`), you can run it locally without Python:

1. **Install Ollama:** Download from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com).
2. **Create a Modelfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM ./models/GGUF/gemma-2b-finqa.gguf
SYSTEM "You are a helpful financial assistant."

```


3. **Run:**
```bash
ollama create pocketquant -f Modelfile
ollama run pocketquant

```





You now have documentation for the main project, the notebooks, and the models.
Would you like me to write the **`.gitignore`** file itself so you don't accidentally upload 2GB of model weights to GitHub?
